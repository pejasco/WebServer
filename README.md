## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- Make utility
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webserver.git webserver
   cd webserver
   ```

2. **Compile the server**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run with default configuration**
   ```bash
   # webserver with default configuration file
   ./webserver

   # Webserver with custom configuration file
   ./webserver config/your_filename.conf
   ```

4. **Test the server**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   # or open in browser
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Configuration Example

```nginx
# config/server.conf
server {	
	host: 127.0.0.1
	port: 8080 8081 8082
	server_names: Example.com www.example.com
	client_max_body_size: 10M
	keep_alive: on
	error_pages {
		404 /documents/errors/404.html
		500 /documents/errors/500.html
	}

	location / {
		root: folder_path
		methods: GET POST DELETE 
		index: filename_index
	}
}
```

## 🔧 HTTP Methods Supported

| Method | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `GET` | ✅ Complete | Retrieve resources |
| `POST` | 🔄 In progress | Submit data, file uploads |
| `DELETE` | 🔄 In progress | Delete resources |

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Test different HTTP methods
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/file.txt

# Test file upload
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.txt" http://localhost:8080/upload/

# Test CGI
curl http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/info.py

# Stress test with Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/
```

### Available Test Scripts

## 🔧 Building and Compilation

```bash
# Standard build
make

# Clean build files
make clean

# Complete clean
make fclean

# Rebuild everything

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :8080 #or other ports
# Kill the process or change port in config
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# Make sure you have permissions for the port
sudo ./webserver  # For ports < 1024
```

**CGI scripts not executing:**
```bash
# Check script permissions
chmod +x www/cgi-bin/script.py
# Check script outside program
./script.py
# Verify interpreter path in config
```

**High memory usage:**
```bash
# Run with Valgrind to check for leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full ./webserver
```
